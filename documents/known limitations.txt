Known limitations of this agent:

1. The agent might struggle to grasp the full context behind a patientâ€™s request, such as complex rescheduling requirements due to chronic illness.
2. Some patients who are less tech-savvy may struggle with automated systems and would prefer human interaction.
3. If an integrated service such as SMS or email goes down, reminders or notifications may not work.
4. If patients enter incorrect or incomplete information, the agent might schedule appointments inaccurately or not at all.
5. Handling thousands of appointment requests simultaneously may overwhelm the system, causing delays or crashes.
